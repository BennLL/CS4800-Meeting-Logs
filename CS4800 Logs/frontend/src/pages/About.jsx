                Nameless was founded in 2025 by a group of computer science students at Cal Poly Pomona for their
                software engineering course. CEO Joseph Moran and his software developers Ali Momennasab, Ethan Ngo, Joshua Yi, 
                and Zihao (Ben) Luo, wanted to create a streaming service that could offer a large amount of movies to movie lovers for free.

                With our diverse skillset across the frontend, backend, and everything in between, we want to 
                deliver the best possible streaming site for our customers. 
            </p>
            <p>
                What started as a college project has evolved into our passion for making entertainment accessible to everyone. 
                We believe that great movies should be available to all, and we&apos;re dedicated to growing our platform while staying true 
                to our original mission of free, quality content for our users.
